The course is regarded as challenging yet fair test of golf, and the immaculate condition of the course has earned it the hosting of EuroPro and European Senior Tour events. The holes are mixed, with some short holes where precision is required and longer holes where well struck approach shots can yield birdies. The facilities are second to none at Ufford Park, with a two-tier floodlit driving range open for golfers to hone their skills before or after their round of golf. Golfers can also enjoy the warm and welcoming atmosphere of the clubhouse where a hearty meal and refreshing drink awaits.",
